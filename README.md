# react-quickstart

A quick and minimal React starter kit. Includes ES6, Sass, Gulp, and Webpack.

React is great! But setting up a ES6/JSX dev environment with Webpack and GUlp is not so great :(

Use this repo to quickly jump into writing beautiful, modular React code!

Run `npm start` to get started.
